Baseline methods:
- ```TS-UIO```: The full-order TS fuzzy UIO [Ref](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9314225)
- ```E2E-UIO```: The designed LPV UIO with an end-to-end approximator (modified from [Ref](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10054430))

## Get Started

### 1.Codes
Full code will be released soon.

### 2.Downloads
Model weights will be released soon.


## TODO
- [x] Upload the initial Readme
- [ ] Release the code and model weights
- [ ] Update code usage tutorial
